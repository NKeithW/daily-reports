#Daily Reports
This is a basic script in python to send email reports as an automated task. 

#Before running the script, make sure to allow access to your Google account by enabling "Less secure app access." You can do this by going to your Google Account settings, then Security, and turn on "Less secure app access." Please be aware that this may pose a security risk, and it's recommended to use an application-specific password or OAuth for a more secure approach.
